A technical test for Moustache Republic

The task was to recreate a web page provided in a framework and language of your choice. 

"This a simple product details section of a clothing retail site. Your task is to implement it with  your weapon of choice, including but not limited to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will be assessed on the completions of the requirements and your general code quality and best coding practices.

Requirements

Implement a web page based on the design prototype, you do NOT have to be “pixel perfect”. But we would recommend trying to meet 90% of the design at the same same screen size.
Responsive web design. The site needs to fit to the different size of the user’s screen. Only large desktop and mobile design are provided. You need to fill in the blank on what the page looks like in between.
Add to Cart section (main body of the page)

When page first loaded there is no size selected. (desktop screen 1, mobile screen 1)
Selected size is shown next to the size label, tile is highlighted as shown in the prototype (desktop screen 4, mobile screen 3).
Add to Cart button on hover colour changes, apply a 0.2 second transition to animate this (desktop screen 3)
Mini Cart section (top right)

On desktop, Mini Cart is shown when mouse hovering over “My Cart”. On mobile devices, Mini Cart is shown when the user taps “My Cart” (desktop screen 2, mobile screen 2)
If you are not doing the optional task below, implement the Mini Cart content same as what is in the design prototype. On the other hand if you are implementing the add to cart JS, the user should start with an empty Mini Cart.
Optional Task: JavaScript add to cart functionality."
